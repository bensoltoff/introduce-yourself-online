## Activity

TIME: ‚è± 10 minutes

Go to this repo:
<https://github.com/hugo-apero/iyo-apero>

Click on the ‚ÄúDeploy to Netlify‚Äù button üöÄ

### Clone GitHub repo

We just created:

-   a full `blogdown` project‚Ä¶
-   containing a Hugo site‚Ä¶
-   deployed to Netlify‚Ä¶
-   in a remote repository on YOUR GitHub (i.e., `https://github.com/<you>/iyo-apero`; you may have changed the repo name after clicking on the ‚ÄúDeploy to Netlify‚Äù button).

To make a local copy on our computer that we can actually work in, we‚Äôll clone that repository into a new RStudio project. This will allow us to sync between the two locations: your remote (the one you see on github.com, and the one continuously deployed by Netlify) and your local desktop.

Use the RStudio IDE project wizard:

1.  Open up RStudio to create a new project where your website‚Äôs files will live.

2.  Click `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`.

3.  Paste the URL from GitHub (either HTTPS or SSH)

4.  Be intentional about where you tell RStudio to create this new Project on your workstation.

5.  Click Create Project.

### Serve your site locally

Use the serve site add-in from the blogdown package to preview your site:

![](addin-serve-site.png)

You should be **all set** to now commit / push / pull from your *personal* GitHub repository freely! Every commit to the `main` branch will trigger your Hugo site to be built and deployed again via Netlify üÜí

### File scavenger hunt

You have 10 minutes to get to know this new Hugo site.

How? Meet the here bot! :mag:

Try to use the here bot messages to find the content file that produces the content in this starter site. There are:

-   3 blog posts
-   3 projects
-   3 talks

There are also 3 kinds of ‚Äúlayouts‚Äù:

-   Single
-   Single sidebar
-   Single series

See if you can spot all of these! Think of it like an easter egg hunt :egg:
