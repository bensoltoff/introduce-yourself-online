  In this workshop, we'll build and deploy *many* websites. We'll cover basic website care and feeding like using R Markdown to create content, and how to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for publishing. We will primarily use the RStudio IDE and R packages from the R Markdown family including `distill` and `blogdown`. Are you ready to get started? Read on...
