  In this workshop, we'll build and deploy *many* websites. We will primarily use the RStudio IDE and R packages from the R Markdown family including `distill` and `blogdown`. We'll also rely heavily on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for publishing. Are you ready to get started? Read on...
